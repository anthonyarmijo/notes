# Highlights
* If the last character of the shell prompt is a hash mark (**#**) rather than a dollar sign, the terminal session has **superuser privileges**.
	> This means we logged in as root or we selected a terminal emulator that provides superuser privileges.

* Every linux user gets their own *home directory* -- by default this is the only place a regular user is allowed to write.
